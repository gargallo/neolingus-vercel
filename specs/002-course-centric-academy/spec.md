# Feature Specification: Course-Centric Academy Architecture

**Feature Branch**: `002-course-centric-academy`  
**Created**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Course-Centric Academy Architecture: Implement a multi-language certification platform starting with EOI English (B2, C1) and JQCV Valenciano. Users select language ‚Üí level ‚Üí dedicated course dashboard with exam simulators, AI tutoring, and progress tracking. Must integrate with Supabase MCP, comply with GDPR/LOPD, and support modular certification expansion (DELF, Goethe, CILS in future phases). Note: Context7 MCP is for documentation retrieval, not AI tutoring."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a language certification candidate, I want to access a dedicated course dashboard for my specific language and level (e.g., English B2, Valenciano C1) where I can practice with official exam simulators, receive AI-powered tutoring, and track my progress toward certification success.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I'm a new user, **When** I access the academy, **Then** I can select from available languages (English, Valenciano)
2. **Given** I've selected English, **When** I choose my target level (B2, C1), **Then** I'm taken to a dedicated English B2/C1 dashboard
3. **Given** I'm in my course dashboard, **When** I want to practice, **Then** I can access official exam format simulators (Reading, Writing, Listening, Speaking)
4. **Given** I'm practicing an exam section, **When** I need help, **Then** I can access AI tutoring that understands the specific certification requirements
5. **Given** I've completed practice sessions, **When** I check my progress, **Then** I can see detailed analytics aligned with official assessment rubrics
6. **Given** I'm preparing for JQCV Valenciano, **When** I access my dashboard, **Then** all content is appropriately localized and follows Valencian assessment standards

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to access a certification module that isn't available yet?
- How does the system handle users who want to prepare for multiple certifications simultaneously?
- What occurs when AI tutoring services are temporarily unavailable?
- How does the system maintain progress data integrity during certification module updates?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a language selection interface showing available certification tracks (Phase 1: English EOI, Valenciano JQCV)
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide level selection within each language (English: B2, C1; Valenciano: B2, C1, C2)
- **FR-003**: System MUST create dedicated course dashboards that adapt completely to the selected language and level combination
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide official exam format simulators for each certification (Reading, Writing, Listening, Speaking components)
- **FR-005**: System MUST integrate AI tutoring that understands specific certification requirements and assessment rubrics
- **FR-006**: System MUST track and display progress analytics aligned with official certification standards
- **FR-007**: System MUST support modular architecture allowing future certification additions (DELF, Goethe, CILS)
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain separate, independent data stores for each certification module
- **FR-009**: System MUST comply with GDPR and LOPD regulations for educational data handling
- **FR-010**: System MUST integrate with Supabase MCP for all database operations
- **FR-011**: System MUST use direct AI SDK integration for tutoring (Context7 MCP is for documentation only)
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide responsive, app-like interface design with smooth animations
- **FR-013**: System MUST authenticate users and manage access to course content
- **FR-014**: System MUST allow users to pause and resume exam simulations
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide immediate feedback on practice exercises aligned with official scoring rubrics

### Key Entities

- **Course**: Represents a specific language-level combination (e.g., "English B2 EOI", "Valenciano C1 JQCV") with associated exam types, content, and assessment criteria
- **User Profile**: Student account with selected courses, progress data, preferences, and compliance consent
- **Exam Session**: Individual practice or assessment attempts with timing, responses, scores, and AI feedback
- **Progress Analytics**: Aggregated performance data showing strengths, weaknesses, and readiness indicators per certification component
- **Certification Module**: Independent, self-contained course system supporting specific official certifications with own content, assessments, and compliance requirements
- **AI Tutor Context**: Contextual assistance tailored to specific certification requirements, user performance patterns, and official assessment rubrics
