## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a language learner preparing for official certifications (EOI, JQCV), I want to select my target language and level, access a personalized course dashboard, and practice with authentic exam formats that faithfully replicate official certification tests, all within a spectacular app-like interface that makes learning engaging and effective.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I'm a new user on the academy homepage, **When** I select "English" as my language, **Then** I see available EOI levels (B2, C1) with clear descriptions and requirements
2. **Given** I've selected "English B2", **When** I access my course dashboard, **Then** I see a personalized interface adapted specifically for EOI B2 preparation with progress tracking, exam types, and study materials
3. **Given** I'm in my English B2 dashboard, **When** I select "Reading Exam", **Then** I access an authentic EOI B2 reading test that matches official format, timing, and difficulty
4. **Given** I'm using the Valenciano course, **When** I navigate to any section, **Then** the entire interface adapts to Valencian language and JQCV certification standards
5. **Given** I'm taking a practice exam, **When** I complete it, **Then** I receive detailed feedback based on official certification rubrics and AI-powered analysis

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user switches between different language courses mid-session?
- How does the system handle incomplete exam sessions when user navigates away?
- What occurs when exam content fails to load or AI features are unavailable?
- How does the interface adapt for users with accessibility needs across different languages?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide language selection interface with available certifications (EOI English, JQCV Valenciano)
- **FR-002**: System MUST display level selection specific to chosen language (B2/C1 for English, official JQCV levels for Valenciano)
- **FR-003**: Users MUST access a personalized dashboard that adapts completely to their selected language and level combination
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide course-specific navigation that reflects the cultural and linguistic context of the selected certification
- **FR-005**: System MUST offer authentic exam types that faithfully replicate official certification formats (EOI/JQCV)
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to seamlessly switch between different courses while maintaining separate progress tracking
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide app-like user interface with modern, responsive design and smooth animations
- **FR-008**: System MUST display all content, interface elements, and navigation in the language appropriate to the selected course
- **FR-009**: System MUST track user progress separately for each language/level combination
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide AI-powered feedback and tutoring specific to each certification type
- **FR-011**: System MUST ensure exam content authenticity matches official certification standards exactly
- **FR-012**: Users MUST be able to access course materials, practice exercises, and mock exams within their selected course context
