                        <h4>Growing Food in the City</h4>
                        <p>
                            In cities around the world, people are discovering the joys of urban gardening. From rooftop gardens in New York to community plots in London, city dwellers are finding creative ways to grow their own food despite limited space and concrete surroundings.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Urban gardening isn't just about saving money on groceries, though that's certainly a benefit. Many people find that growing their own vegetables and herbs gives them a sense of connection to their food and the environment. "There's something magical about planting a seed and watching it grow into something you can eat," says Maria Santos, who tends a small garden on her apartment balcony in Barcelona.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The practice is also bringing communities together. In many neighborhoods, residents have converted empty lots into shared growing spaces where people of all ages work side by side. These community gardens often become social hubs where neighbors meet, share knowledge, and build friendships that might never have formed otherwise.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, urban gardening does present some challenges. Limited space means gardeners must be creative with vertical growing systems and container gardens. City soil can be contaminated, so many urban gardeners use raised beds with imported soil. And finding enough sunlight in areas surrounded by tall buildings can be difficult.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Despite these obstacles, the urban gardening movement continues to grow. City governments are beginning to recognize the benefits and are providing support through grants for community gardens and relaxed regulations for rooftop farming. As more people seek sustainable ways of living, urban gardening offers a promising solution for creating greener, more self-sufficient cities.

                            <h4>The History of the Bicycle</h4>
                            <p>
                                The bicycle has been one of the most important inventions in human transportation. Its development took place over many decades in the 19th century. <span class="gap" data-gap="16" id="gap-16">(16)</span>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The first machine that resembled a bicycle was invented in 1817 by Baron Karl von Drais in Germany. However, this early version had no pedals and riders had to push themselves along with their feet. <span class="gap" data-gap="17" id="gap-17">(17)</span>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the 1860s, pedals were finally added to the front wheel, creating what was called the "velocipede." <span class="gap" data-gap="18" id="gap-18">(18)</span> Despite being uncomfortable to ride, it became quite popular in France and other parts of Europe.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The next major development came in the 1870s with the creation of the "ordinary" or "penny-farthing" bicycle. <span class="gap" data-gap="19" id="gap-19">(19)</span> This design allowed riders to go faster, but it was also more dangerous because of the high center of gravity.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Finally, in the 1880s, the "safety bicycle" was invented. This had two wheels of equal size and a chain drive to the rear wheel. <span class="gap" data-gap="20" id="gap-20">(20)</span> This design became the basis for all modern bicycles.

                        <h4>The Rise of Electric Vehicles</h4>
                        <p>
                            Electric vehicles are becoming increasingly popular around the world. Many people are choosing (27) _____ buy electric cars because they are better for the environment than traditional petrol cars. Governments are also encouraging people to make the switch by offering financial incentives.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One of the main advantages of electric cars (28) _____ that they produce no emissions while driving. This helps to reduce air pollution in cities, (29) _____ is especially important for public health. Electric cars are also much quieter than conventional vehicles.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, there are still some challenges. The biggest concern for many potential buyers is (30) _____ far they can travel on a single charge. Most modern electric cars can travel between 200-300 kilometers, but this is still less than petrol cars.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another issue is the lack of charging stations. Although the number of charging points is growing rapidly, drivers still need to plan their journeys carefully. Many people (31) _____ live in apartments also find it difficult to charge their cars at home.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Despite these challenges, experts predict that electric vehicles will soon make (32) _____ the majority of new car sales. As battery technology continues to improve and charging infrastructure expands, electric cars are likely to become the norm rather than the exception.
