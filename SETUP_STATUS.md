# Neolingus Academy Platform - Setup Status

## Current Status

✅ The project codebase is complete and compiles without TypeScript errors
✅ The development server runs successfully on port 3001
✅ All 41 implementation tasks from the spec-driven development workflow have been completed
✅ Authentication system is in place with Supabase Auth
✅ API routes are implemented
✅ UI components are created
✅ Database schema is defined

## What's Working

- Development server starts without errors
- Main application pages load (redirecting to sign-in as expected)
- Authentication flow is implemented
- API endpoints are defined
- UI components render
- TypeScript compilation passes

## What Still Needs to be Done

### 1. Environment Configuration ⚠️ REQUIRED
Create a proper `.env.local` file with actual credentials:
- Supabase project URL and keys
- AI provider API keys (OpenAI at minimum)
- Update.dev configuration

### 2. Database Setup ⚠️ REQUIRED
Apply the database migration:
- Run `supabase/migrations/20250910000000_create_academy_system.sql` in your Supabase project
- This creates all necessary tables with RLS policies

### 3. Admin User Creation ⚠️ REQUIRED
Set up the admin user:
- Run `npm run setup` to create the admin user
- Default credentials: admin@neolingus.com / TempAdminPass123!
- Change password immediately after first login

### 4. Supabase Configuration ⚠️ REQUIRED
Configure your Supabase project:
- Enable Auth providers you want to use
- Set up OAuth credentials for Google/GitHub if needed
- Configure email templates

### 5. AI Provider Setup (Optional but Recommended)
Configure AI providers for full functionality:
- OpenAI API key for GPT models (required for AI tutoring)
- Anthropic API key for Claude models (optional)
- Google AI API key for Gemini models (optional)

## Testing the Application

Once the above steps are completed, you can:

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or next available port)
3. Sign in with the admin credentials
4. Access the admin dashboard at `/admin`
5. Access the academy at `/dashboard`

## Next Steps for Full Functionality

1. Set up a real Supabase project and configure credentials
2. Apply the database migration to create tables
3. Create the admin user
4. Configure AI provider keys for AI tutoring features
5. Test all functionality including:
   - Course selection and enrollment
   - Exam simulation
   - AI tutoring
   - Progress tracking
   - Admin dashboard

The application architecture is sound and follows the specification. The remaining work is operational setup rather than code implementation.
